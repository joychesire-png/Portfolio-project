      Hello, I'm Chesire. Someone with a passion for music, philosophy,
      instruments, soaking up all knowledge I could get because you can never
      learn too much, right?
    </p>
    <p class="texts">
      <br />I love exploring the depths of ontology and expressing myself
      through my fashion. And when I'm not lost in thought, you'll find me
      enjoying the finer things in life, like a great scent, or diving into the
      world of cinema as a cinephile.

      I'm always down to explore new experiences, new restraunts, new music and
      new places; My current drive for that being this quote by
      <mark>Lester Burnham</mark> from the film <mark>American Beauty</mark>;

      <mark>
        "It's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world.
        Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much. My
        heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst. And then I remember
        to relax, and just appreciate the little things. The taste of rain, the
        smell of the earth, the way the light catches the leaves."</mark
