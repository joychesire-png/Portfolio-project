      Hello, I'm Chesire. Someone with a passion for music, philosophy,
      instruments, soaking up all knowledge I could get because you can never
      learn too much, right?
    </p>
    <p class="texts">
      <br />I love exploring the depths of ontology and expressing myself
      through my fashion. And when I'm not lost in thought, you'll find me
      enjoying the finer things in life, like a great scent, or diving into the
      world of cinema as a cinephile.

      I'm always down to explore new experiences, new restraunts, new music and
      new places; My current drive for that being this quote by
      <mark>Lester Burnham</mark> from the film <mark>American Beauty</mark>;

        "It's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world.
        Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much. My
        heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst. And then I remember
        to relax, and just appreciate the little things. The taste of rain, the
        smell of the earth, the way the light catches the leaves."</mark

    <h1 id="heading"><u>About</u></h1>
    <p class="texts">
      I'm currently studying Software Engineering at Moringa. And while my
      background isn't primarily Computer science, I've always been fascinated
      by how websites and web pages work. I'm really excited to understand the
      'behind the scenes' and see how I can build things myself.
    </p>
    <h1 id="heading"><u>Skills</u></h1>
    <p class="texts">
      I'm a strong communicator and very dependable in my work ethic. I'd say my
      interpersonal skills are strong, especially when it comes to building
      relationships because I'm a quite a social person.
    </p>
    <p class="texts">
      I'm still developing my technical skills. Currently, my computer and I are
      in a love-hate relationship. Especially since I'm still adjusting to the
      9-to-5 life. But so far so good, I'm loving it; at the expense of my back.
